The spread between corporate and Treasury bond yields represents the credit risk premium investors demand to hold corporate bonds over ‘risk-free’ government bonds.

Treasury yields reflect the baseline cost of capital (risk-free rate), while corporate bond yields include additional compensation for default risk, liquidity, and other factors.

A widening spread typically signals increased market concern about corporate creditworthiness (e.g., during recessions), while a narrowing spread can indicate improving investor confidence.
